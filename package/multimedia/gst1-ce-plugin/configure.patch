+# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
+# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
+# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
+#
+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
+# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
+# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#
+# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
+# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a

+\`configure' configures GStreamer CE Plugins 0.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX

+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+

+2008-12-17  Edward Hervey  <bilboed@gmail.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	And yet another variation of the GstAudioFilter leak.
+
+2008-12-15  Sebastian Dröge  <sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	Patch by: Roland Illig <roland dot illig at gmx dot de>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	Fix AG_GST_BISON_CHECK to handle version numbers with more than
+	two components (i.e. 2.4.1). Fixes bug #564507.
+
+2008-12-14  Edward Hervey  <bilboed@gmail.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	And yet another variant of the GstAudioFilter leak.
+
+2008-12-13  Edward Hervey  <edward.hervey@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Added variants of leaks of dynamic pad templates created in
+	GstAudioFilter.
+	Add conditional jump triggered by getaddrinfo (maybe glibc-2.9).
+
+2008-12-12  Edward Hervey  <edward.hervey@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Fix leak in GIO called by gnomevfs. Nothing we can do about this.
+
+2008-12-12  Edward Hervey  <edward.hervey@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Added another suppression for dynamic pad templates, in this case
+	GstAudioFilter.
+	Added suppression for PangoLanguage which can never be freed
+	according to the Pango API.
+
+2008-12-12  Edward Hervey  <edward.hervey@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	A whole bunch of suppressions detected on latest gentoo ~amd64.
+	Make some existing suppressions more generic (for subtle dependecy
+	code changes).
+	Added suppressions for glibc-2.9.
+	Added suppressions for new variants of ALSA leaks.
+	Added suppressions for a series of leaks in plugins registrations due
+	to some pad templates' caps calculated at runtime.
+	Added suppressions for variants of some leaks in pango/fontconfig.
+	Added suppressions for leak in gstffmpegcsp.c (nothing we can do
+	about it, but will only exist once).
+
+2008-12-04  Sebastian Dröge  <sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* m4/gst-plugin-docs.m4:
+	Remove the check if $have_gtk_doc equals yes as it's not defined
+	and $enable_gtk_doc should be good enough.
+	Also this restores the build of the plugin documentation.
+
+2008-12-01  Mark Nauwelaerts  <mark.nauwelaerts@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add suppression variant for Ubuntu Hardy x86/64bit.
+
+2008-12-01  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	  Simplily uninstall rule. Its closer to upstream and fixes #150331.
+
+2008-11-29  Sebastian Dröge  <sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* m4/glib-gettext.m4:
+	Update glib-gettext.m4 from latest stable GLib release.
+
+2008-11-29  Sebastian Dröge  <sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	Patch by: Cygwin Ports maintainer
+	           <yselkowitz at users dot sourceforge dot net>
+
+	* gettext.patch:
+	Update the gettext patch for use with gettext 0.17 which is
+	required to build with libtool 2.2 because of conflicts.
+	First part of bug #556091.
+
+2008-11-29  Sebastian Dröge  <sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* m4/gtk-doc.m4:
+	* m4/pkg.m4:
+	Update gtk-doc and pkg-config m4 macros from their latest releases.
+
+2008-11-20  Michael Smith <msmith@songbirdnest.com>
+
+	* m4/as-objc.m4:
+	  Fix objective C test macro when none of the compilers are found at all.
+
+2008-10-30  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	  Also cp the entities here to all xinlcude based docs (workaround for
+	  not being able to set up a search path).
+
+2008-10-17  Jan Schmidt  <jan.schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	  Don't clobber the real registry cache file when

+
+2008-10-06  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gtk-doc.mak:

+	  CVS.
+
+2008-09-05  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak: Fix the check for gtkdoc-rebase: don't
+	  pass the 'which' error back to make.  This fix is more specific
+	  than what is in upstream.

+	  gtkdoc-rebase (if exists).
+
+2008-08-21  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	  Revert $(top_builddir) -> $(builddir) change of rev. 1.39 as there is
+	  no variable called builddir.
+
+2008-07-31  Mark Nauwelaerts  <mark.nauwelaerts@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gst.supp:

+	  When checking for GST_ERROR_CXXFLAGS, check each compiler flag
+	  individually, not all together.
+
+2008-07-20  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim.muller at collabora co uk>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4::
+	  Fix bison version number detection for older --version

+	  Fixes #543853.
+
+2008-07-12  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* plugins.xsl:
+	  Split refsect2 also here to make "Element Pads" subtitle visible.
+
+2008-07-08  Sebastian Dröge  <sebastian.droege@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	Add compiler flags to warn if declarations after statements or
+	variable length arrays are used. These are C99/GCC extensions and
+	are not supported by some compilers we want to support.
+
+2008-07-02  Mark Nauwelaerts  <mark.nauwelaerts@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:

+
+2008-06-20  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gstdoc-scangobj:
+	Always use format strings for printf-like functions, even if they just
+	print a string. Fixes bug #536981.
+
+2008-06-20  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	Include CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in GTKDOC_CFLAGS and GTKDOC_LDFLAGS,
+	otherwise the values passed to configure are ignored.
+	Fixes bug #536978.
+
+2008-06-05  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim.muller at collabora co uk>
+
+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	  Add -fno-strict-aliasing when compiling with -Werror, to work around
+	  warnings caused by G_LOCK with recent GLib versions (2.16.x) (#316221).
+
+2008-06-05  Jan Schmidt  <jan.schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	Don't copy html/*.png files unless they don't already exist
+	in the destdir. Fixes distcheck failure caused by permissions
+	problems trying to copy a file into the destdir when it already
+	exists.
+
+2008-05-28  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* plugins.xsl:
+	  The class was not shown in plugin docs. Fix typo in changelog below.

+
+2008-05-17  Jan Schmidt  <jan.schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	Be more quiet when the files don't yet exist.
+
+2008-05-16  Jan Schmidt  <jan.schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* gstdoc-scangobj:
+	Add a mechanism for adding 'implicitly created' GTypes into the
+	scan, allowing for documenting plugin-private base classes that
+	provide signals or properties for public elements.
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	Use $(builddir) instead of $(top_builddir) in a few places - there's
+	no need to hard code 'docs/plugins' as the only useable path.
+
+2008-05-14  Peter Kjellerstedt  <pkj@axis.com>
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	Report plug-ins without external dependencies that will not be built
+	even when the name of the plug-in is a substring of another plug-in,
+	e.g., goom vs. goom2k1.
+
+2008-05-14  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim.muller at collabora co uk>

+	Fixes bug #532295.
+
+2008-05-07  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim.muller at collabora co uk>
+
+	* check.mak: (help):
+	  Document GST_CHECKS environment variable in checks 'make help'.
+
+2008-05-06  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	Patch by: Marc-Andre Lureau <marcandre dot lureau at gmail dot com>
+
+	* scangobj-merge.py:
+	Don't depend on Twisted just for the OrderedDict but implement our
+	own ordered dictionary class. Fixes bug #531577.
+
+2008-04-23  Edward Hervey  <edward.hervey@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Re-arrange latest suppressions.
+	Add all known suppressions for ubuntu hardy. Same as for older
+	ubuntus, but with different codepaths.
+
+2008-04-22  Edward Hervey  <bilboed@gmail.com>
+
+	* gst.supp: Make tls leak suppression a bit more generic.
+
+2008-04-22  Edward Hervey  <bilboed@gmail.com>
+
+	* gst.supp: Fix ommission in latest commit.
+	Make tls leak suppression more generic in order to cover more
+	distributions (and hopefully also future distributions).
+
+2008-04-22  Edward Hervey  <bilboed@gmail.com>
+
+	* gst.supp: Add suppressions for Hardy.
+	They're just the newer versions of similar suppressions we had
+	for the previous versions of ubuntu.
+
+2008-04-15  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* Makefile.am:
+	* m4/Makefile.am:
+	Dist all files in common. Fixes bug #527984.
+
+2008-04-14  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/gst-function.m4:
+	  Rename AC_CACHE_VAL cache-ids to contain '_cv_' in order to make
+	  autoconf-2.62 complain less.
+
+2008-04-13  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	* m4/gst-valgrind.m4:
+	  Bump valgrind requirement to 3.0 (which was released in August 2005).
+	  Fixes #489269. Also, check for version >=REQ and not >REQ.
+
+2008-04-09  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/gst-default.m4:
+	  Add --with-default-{audiosink|audiosrc|videosink|videosrc|visualizer}
+	  configure switches (#519417).
+
+2008-04-03  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+

+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	Unconditionally require flex 2.5.31 and bison 1.875.
+
+2008-03-23  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-arch.m4:
+	amd64/x86_64 allows unaligned memory access too.
+
+2008-03-21  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-dowhile.m4:
+	Add macro that checks if the compiler supports do {} while (0)
+	macros and define HAVE_DOWHILE_MACROS if it does. This is
+	needed by glib/gmacros.h to use something else than
+	if (1) else for G_STMT_START/END when compling C++, which
+	causes compiler warnings because of ambigious else with g++ 4.3.
+
+2008-03-21  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-plugin-docs.m4:
+	* mangle-tmpl.py:
+	Don't depend on PyXML and use only XML modules that are shipped
+	with python. Fixes bug #519635.
+
+2008-03-07  Edward Hervey  <edward.hervey@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* m4/gtk-doc.m4: (GTK_DOC_CHECK): 
+	The previous commit to this file by Stefan Kost mentionned checking for
+	SED, but NOT checking for gtkdoc-check (wth is that doing there ??).
+	Therefore, removing the check for gtkdoc-check
+
+2008-03-03  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>
+
+	* m4/ax_create_stdint_h.m4: Oops, checked in the wrong copy of
+	  this file.  (Update from upstream)
+
+2008-03-03  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>
+
+	* m4/ax_create_stdint_h.m4:  Update from upstream.  Fixes a bug
+	  compiling with MSVC.
+
+2008-03-03  Edward Hervey  <edward.hervey@collabora.co.uk>
+
+	* m4/pkg.m4:
+	Allow override of pkg-config results, as proposed by configure --help.
+	This is in fact just a backport from upstream pkg.m4.
+	Fixes #518892
+
+2008-03-03  Peter Kjellerstedt  <pkj@axis.com>
+
+	* ChangeLog:
+	Changelog surgery of my previous commit to add bugzilla reference.
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	Add AG_GST_CHECK_PLUGIN and AG_GST_DISABLE_PLUGIN to make it easier
+	to include and exclude plug-ins without external references, i.e.,
+	plug-ins listed in GST_PLUGINS_SELECTED. (#498222)
+
+2008-03-03  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add another glibc suppression.
+
+2008-02-29  Peter Kjellerstedt  <pkj@axis.com>
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	Make the comment before defines generated via AG_GST_CHECK_FEATURE
+	look nicer. (#498222)
+
+2008-02-26  Jan Schmidt  <jan.schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* m4/Makefile.am:
+	* m4/as-gcc-inline-assembly.m4:
+	Add Dave Schleef's GCC inline assembly detection macro
+	for using in gst-plugins-good in the goom 2k4 plugin.
+
+2008-02-25  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>
+
+	* gst-autogen.sh: Instead of only passing certain arguments to
+	configure, pass anything that we didn't handle. Much friendlier.
+	Fixes #34412.
+
+2008-02-23  Jan Schmidt  <Jan.Schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	Store the detected compiler flags into ERROR_CFLAGS rather than
+	ERROR_CXXFLAGS, and use the macro that checks the C compiler, not
+	the C++ one.
+
+2008-02-23  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	  Reflow checks for additional warning flags so they're not
+	  nested, which fixes the result reporting in the configure
+	  output.
+
+2008-02-22  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/as-compiler-flag.m4:
+	  Add AS_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG
+
+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	  Add AG_GST_SET_ERROR_CXXFLAGS (Forte bits need testing)
+
+2008-02-22  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	  Add 'check-inspected-versions' target; this helps identify
+	  files that should have been removed or where the version
+	  number should (ideally) be updated before a release
+	  (which doesn't happen automatically if the releaser doesn't
+	  build that plugin locally). Not adding at a distcheck hook
+	  yet though, because it's not really that important and would
+	  probably also be a problem on buildbots.
+
+2008-02-22  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add even more glibc 2.7 suppressions.
+
+2008-02-22  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add another suppression for GLib caching some values after
+	the first call.
+
+2008-02-12  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	Patch by:
+	  Tim Mooney <mooney at dogbert dot cc dot ndsu dot nodak dot edu>
+
+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	Use no%E_MACRO_REDEFINED on Solaris to prevent compiler warnings.
+	Fixes bug #515905.
+
+2008-02-11  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add a few more glibc 2.7 suppressions to make the avisubtitle unit
+	test valgrind clean. Fixes bug #515703.
+
+2008-02-08  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* ChangeLog:
+	  Changelog surgery for last commit.
+
+2008-02-08  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* m4/gtk-doc.m4:
+	  Conditionally check for SED. Also sync a bit with upstream macro.
+
+2008-02-08  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	  Use '$(SED)' instead of 'sed'. Don't use -i for in-place as its gnu
+	  only, move to a temp file instead.
+
+2008-02-06  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	 As our docs are versioned, we need to patch the index.sgml file to have
+	 correct paths there, unless we also want to fork gtk-doc's xsl (which
+	 we don't). This hopefully fixes xrefs between modules.
+
+2008-02-02  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	Use printf instead of echo as "echo -e" isn't POSIX and doesn't work
+	with strict POSIX shells like tcsh or dash and also not every platform
+	has a /bin/echo that supports it.
+
+2008-01-24  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* ChangeLog:
+	  ChangeLog surgery.
+
+	* gstdoc-scangobj:
+	  Sync the object scanner with gtk-doc fixes. Update args and hierarchy
+	  files.
+
+2008-01-20  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	* coverage/lcov.mak:
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	* release.mak:
+	Use $(MAKE) instead of make to fix the build if GNU make is called
+	something else on the system.
+	
+	* m4/as-docbook.m4:
+	Fix path for docbook.xsl if we have no /etc/xml/catalog and add a
+	docbook-xsl search path for FreeBSD.
+
+2008-01-18  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add a suppression for a glibc bug:
+	http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/faq.html#faq.exit_errors>
+
+2008-01-18  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add some more glibc 2.7 suppressions and make the GLib suppressions
+	for the home/tmp/etc directory caching a bit more generic.
+
+2008-01-18  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add some glibc 2.7 supressions as found on Debian/unstable.
+
+2008-01-14  Jan Schmidt  <jan.schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* download-translations:
+	Apparently I have problems with leaving things commented out when
+	I edit shell scripts.
+
+2008-01-12  Jan Schmidt  <Jan.Schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* download-translations:
+	Remove bash-isms
+
+2008-01-12  Jan Schmidt  <Jan.Schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* check-exports:
+	Restore the cleanup rm of our tmp file which I didn't mean to leave 
+	commented out.
+
+2008-01-12  Jan Schmidt  <Jan.Schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* check-exports:
+	  Fixes to make check-export work on both Solaris and Linux
+
+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	  Disable extra warning category (argument mismatch) as an error
+	  on Forte, as it prevents the libcheck fail_if macros from compiling.
+
+	* win32.mak:
+	  Substitute the GStreamer version so things will keep working in 0.11
+
+2008-01-11  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	Patch by: Peter Kjellerstedt <pkj axis com>
+
+	* m4/gst-glib2.m4:
+	* m4/gst-libxml2.m4:
+	  Improve/fix output from configure if either glib-2.0 or
+	  libxml2 are not installed (#498222).
+
+2008-01-09  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* coverage/lcov.mak:
+	  Update coverage make-rules: use them conditionaly, use libtool mode
+	  and use lcov to cleanup.
+
+2007-12-18  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* glib-gen.mak:
+	  Also use #include "header" instead of #include <header> for the
+	  headers that were used to generate the source files for the same
+	  reason as below.
+
+	  Remove whitespace before #include.
+
+2007-12-18  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* glib-gen.mak:
+	  Use #include "header" instead of #include <header> for the generated
+	  enum C files as the file will always be in the same directory and
+	  some compilers seem to be a bit strict about that unless . is added
+	  to the include path.
+
+	  Include all headers that were used to generate the source files in
+	  the C file as they're used there.
+
+2007-12-17  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* win32.mak: (win32), (win32defs), (win32crlf):
+	  Make check for CR LF in Visual C++ 6.0 project files
+	  work, based on patch by David Schleef (#496722, #393626).
+	
+2007-12-17  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>

+
+2007-12-17  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>

+2007-12-15  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	  We should have never forked this that much :/.
+
+2007-12-13  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* check-exports:
+	  Fix build on the ppc64 build bot.
+
+2007-12-13  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* check-exports:
+	  Suppress more unintentional exports (too much hassle to rename them,
+	  since the win32 project files would need changing too).
+
+2007-12-12  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* Makefile.am:
+	  check-exports should be disted.
+
+2007-12-12  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* check-exports:
+	  Add quick'n'dirty script to check the exported symbols of a library
+	  against the symbols in the corresponding .def file (#493983). Based
+	  on script by Ole André Vadla Ravnås.
+
+2007-11-06  Jan Schmidt  <jan.schmidt@sun.com>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	Fix distcheck by making sure the types files are treated like the
+	other gtkdoc-scangobj generated files.
+
+2007-09-21  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	  Let the AG_GST_ARG_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL macro default to disable
+	  building of experimental plugins. Nobody uses it yet and the
+	  --enable--experimental stuff from gst-plugins-good defaults to
+	  disable too.
+
+2007-09-06  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	  Just use the normal 'check' target and avoid a circular
+	  dependency.
+
+2007-09-06  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	  Add rule to error out if .hierarchy file contains tabs.
+
+2007-08-20  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* download-translations:
+	* po.mak:
+	  If there are new languages, they need to be added to po/LINGUAS.
+
+2007-08-20  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* download-translations:
+	* po.mak:
+	  Fix up 'download-po' a bit, so that we find new translations
+	  for languages that aren't in our po/LINGUAS file yet too.
+
+2007-07-16  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add a suppression for GLib caching the tmp dir seen on an
+	Ubuntu Feisty system.
+
+2007-07-13  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	If we want to use 'echo -e', call /bin/echo instead of the shell's
+	since -e is a bash extension, and our /bin/sh might not be being
+	provided by bash.
+
+2007-07-01  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* po.mak:
+	  Translation project has moved.  Also, no idea how this used to
+	  work given that we weren't downloading a .po file.
+
+2007-06-25  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* gst-xmlinspect.py:
+	* plugins.xsl:
+	  Also extract element caps for plugin-docs. Fixes parts of #117692.
+
+2007-06-21  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	Patch by: Andreas Schwab
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	  Fix quoting (#449493).
+
+2007-06-10  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	Only generate the parser if bison >= 1.875 _and_ flex >= 2.5.31 is
+	installed and use pre-generated sources otherwise. Fixes bug #444820.
+
+2007-05-11  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	  Suppression variant for our good friend the TLS leak, this time for
+	  Ubuntu Feisty/x86.
+
+2007-05-09  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	  Fix make distcheck again; change some spaces to tabs in makefile.
+
+2007-04-29  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak (-module):
+	  Error out when the html build step gives warnings, so they get
+	  fixed properly.
+
+2007-04-23  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	  Add macro AG_GST_PARSE_SUBSYSTEM_DISABLES that checks the defines in
+	  the configuration header and AC_DEFINES the setings.
+
+2007-04-19  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	Patch by: Vincent Torri <vtorri at univ-evry dot fr>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	Put the AC_MSG_RESULT output in brackets to get it properly written to
+	the terminal.
+
+2007-04-18  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	Check for flex >= 2.5.31 and set GENERATE_PARSER if we have at least
+	that version. Otherwise use pre-generated parser sources as we can't
+	raise the required flex version. HAVE_MT_SAVE_FLEX is obsolete now
+	as we use a new enough flex version anyway. First part of #349180
+
+2007-04-10  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-check.m4:
+	  Allow pre-setting the GST(PB)_TOOLS/PLUGINS_DIR variables to help
+	  builds against older GStreamer.
+
+2007-03-25  Sebastian Dröge  <slomo@circular-chaos.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	Fix the flex version check. It ignored the micro version before.
+
+2007-03-09  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	Use the same timeout when generating valgrind suppressions as 
+	running the valgrind test.
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add some more suppressions and stuff.
+
+2007-03-08  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	Make sure GSlice is disabled when building suppressions too.
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add around *850* lines of suppressions for one-time initialisations
+	inside libasound and gconf/bonobo/ORBit. I feel so dirty.
+
+2007-03-07  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	add a suppression for this GConf flup on the FC5 buildbot.
+
+2007-03-06  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Make the suppression a little more generic, to catch the FC5 
+	backtrace too.
+
+2007-03-06  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Add a suppression for libcdio 0.76. It leaks an internal struct
+	when the CD-ROM device is not accessible.
+
+2007-02-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-arch.m4:
+	  Move a line that was in the wrong macro
+
+2007-02-28  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst.m4:

+	* m4/gst-x11.m4:
+	  Convert all macros to use AG_GST style so we can properly warn
+	  when they're missing if configure.ac calls AG_GST_INIT
+	  Will require update in all GStreamer modules.
+
+2007-02-11  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	  Remove 'enable' from configure switch description as this leads to 
+	  confusing lines like "disable enable builing ...".
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	  Fix comment to sound less horrible.
+
+2007-02-07  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	Patch by: Will Newton  <will.newton gmail com>
+
+	* m4/gst-check.m4:
+	  Use $PKG_CONFIG rather than pkg-config directly, the one in our path
+	  might not be the one we want, like when cross-compiling. Also, other
+	  macros such as PKG_CHECK_MODULES use $PKG_CONFIG, so we should
+	  probably too just for consistency. Fixes #405288.
+
+2007-01-08  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	  Need to use double square brackets again so m4 doesn't remove them
+	  (fixes #378931).
+
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	  Use double square brackets here as well, for the same reason.
+
+2007-01-05  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	  Use 'sed' rather than 'tr' to strip trailing letters from version
+	  numbers, since 'tr' might not be available and we know sed is
+	  (#378931).
+
+2006-10-21  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	  Increase default timeout under valgrind, 60 is just too short and
+	  some tests take a bit longer these days and not everyone has a
+	  beefy machine.
+
+2006-09-29  Michael Smith  <msmith@fluendo.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	  More suppressions for edgy. 
+
+2006-09-28  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* m4/gst-glib2.m4:
+	Use gmodule-no-export-2.0.pc instead of gmodule-2.0.pc - we neither
+	want nor need --export-dynamic (which ends up making us export a bunch
+	of unneeded symbols)
+
+2006-09-14  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	  Some suppressions for the more recent ld.so in ubuntu edgy.
+
+2006-08-23  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	  Shorten function trail so the suppression works on
+	  my ubuntu dapper system with core cvs as well.
+
+2006-07-28  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Extra suppressions from my Ubuntu x86_64 machine
+
+2006-07-24  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	Patch by: Frederic Peters <fpeters at entrouvert com>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	  Need to double square brackets in .m4 files. Should fix bison
+	  version detection with version numbers like 1.23a (#348354).
+
+2006-07-24  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	Valgrind fails to find tests written in tests/check/ directly (rather
+	than a subdir) - because valgrind gets run with a filename that
+	doesn't contain a relative path, it goes searching /usr/bin instead.
+	Run with ./.... to make things work either way.
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	Add $(top_builddir)/src as a place to look for plugins
+	when building too, since that's where gst-template keeps things
+
+2006-07-23  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+

+
+2006-07-21  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>
+
+	* m4/gst-parser.m4:
+	  check for bison and flex
+
+2006-07-13  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-plugin-docs.m4:
+	  remove the configure argument for enabling plugin doc build;
+	  having gtk-doc enabled and pyxml present is enough of a trigger
+
+2006-07-03  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* coverage/lcov.mak:
+	  fix up rules to work with gst-python as well
+	  run "make lcov" to test and generate the reports
+	  run "make lcov-reset" to redo it after that
+
+2006-07-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* Makefile.am:
+	* check.mak:
+	  add an inspect target that inspects every element feature,
+	  so we can have that added for coverage
+	* coverage/lcov.mak:
+	  add support for lcov
+
+2006-07-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	  when building with gcov, reset CFLAGS and friends to O0
+
+2006-07-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	  Find the gcov that matches the gcc version
+	  Only allow gcov if we use gcc
+
+2006-07-02  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* Makefile.am:
+	* coverage/coverage-report-entry.pl:
+	* coverage/coverage-report.pl:
+	* coverage/coverage-report.xsl:
+	  copy coverage reporting files from dbus
+
+2006-07-01  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-args.m4:
+	  libtool strips gcov's -f flags, so libgcov does not get
+	  linked in.  Setting GCOV_LIBS with -lgcov fixes libtool's
+	  stripping
+	  also show what pkg-config-path we set
+
+2006-06-22  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	Patch by: Peter Kjellerstedt <pkj at axis com>
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	  Show list of plugins without external dependencies that
+	  will not be built as well (#344136).
+
+2006-06-15  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* m4/gst-plugin-docs.m4:
+	  add GST_PLUGIN_DOCS, which checks for everything needed
+	  to build the plugin docs (namely gtk-doc and pyxml); also
+	  adds a new --enable-plugin-docs configure switch; will
+	  set ENABLE_PLUGIN_DOCS conditional for use in Makefile.am
+	  files (see #344039).
+
+2006-06-11  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-check.m4:
+	  add GST_PKG_CHECK_MODULES, which in the normal case of checking
+	  for a dependency lib for a plug-in only needs two arguments
+	  to do the right thing.
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	  clean up output a little of feature checking; also deal with
+	  non-plug-in feature checks
+	* m4/Makefile.am:
+	* m4/gst-gstreamer.m4:
+	  remove this file; it's a useless check
+
+2006-06-06  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-arch.m4:
+	  add PPC64 so we can have separate structure sizes for it
+
+2006-06-05  Edward Hervey  <edward@fluendo.com>
+
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	Check for the proper .devhelp2 file to remove.
+
+2006-05-31  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

+	Reverting previous commit.  That's good to know, Edward, but why ?
+	
+2006-05-28  Edward Hervey  <edward@fluendo.com>
+
+	* gst.supp:
+	Added suppresion for memleak in g_option_context_parse on fc5-64
+
+2006-05-19  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gst-check.m4:
+	  set GSTPB_PLUGINS_DIR just like GST_PLUGINS_DIR
+
+2006-05-18  Tim-Philipp Müller  <tim at centricular dot net>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	  Fix 'make help' in check directories, it should be
+	  'valgrind.gen-suppressions' not 'valgrind-gen-suppressions'
+	  (not changing target to match help string on purpose to keep
+	  scripts etc. functional).

+
+2006-04-04  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

+	  make certain doc warnings fatal so people maintain docs again
+
+2005-09-23  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* Makefile.am:

+
+2005-09-14  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>
+
+	* as-libtool.mak: Remove
+	* m4/as-libtool.m4: The libtool bug that this worked around has
+	  been fixed.
+	* m4/as-version.m4: Don't define GST_RELEASE, since it causes
+	  config.h to be regenerated needlessly, and we don't use it.
+
+2005-09-14  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	  error out on inspect failure
+
+2005-09-14  Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>

+

+
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	* gtk-doc.mak:
+	* m4/gst-doc.m4:
+	  separate out gtk-doc and docbook stuff
+	  have two separate --enable configure flags
+
+2005-08-26  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	  add a .gdb target; rebuild registry for each target, otherwise
+	  a code rebuild always triggers a reg rebuild, and it's just too
+	  annoying
+	* gstdoc-scangobj:
+
+2005-08-21  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	  separate out REGISTRY_ENVIRONMENT; we want to use that from
+	  our valgrind runs, but we also want TESTS_ENVIRONMENT to contain
+	  everything that the first test, gst-register, needs
+
+2005-08-21  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	  parse output of valgrind and check for definitely lost, and error
+	  out; somehow I was led to believe valgrind returns non-zero for
+	  leaks, but I can't make it do that, so let's parse
+
+2005-08-20  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* check.mak:
+	  for some weird reason valgrind does not report actual memleaks
+	  if GST_PLUGIN_PATH is set to anything but the core gstreamer dir
+	  while valgrind is running.  Since the registry is going to go
+	  anyway, I don't want to waste any more time on this; I just run
+	  valgrind without GST_PLUGIN_PATH set.  Since the registry loading
+	  doesn't check if GST_PLUGIN_PATH got changed as a reason to rebuild
+	  the registry, that's actually fine.
+
+2005-08-15  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* mangle-tmpl.py:
+	  keep original Long_Description; only insert an include if it's
+	  not already the first line in there
+	* plugins.xsl:
+	  output more information for plugins, including an origin hyperlink
+
+2005-08-15  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* gst-xmlinspect.py:
+	  a first stab at inspecting plugins and outputting an xml description
+	* gtk-doc-plugins.mak:
+	  a gtk-doc using snippet for plugins documentation
+	* plugins.xsl:
+	  a stylesheet to convert gst-xmlinspect.py output to docbook output
+	  for inclusion in the gtk-doc stuff
+
+2005-07-20  Ronald S. Bultje  <rbultje@ronald.bitfreak.net>
+
+	* m4/gst-doc.m4:
+	  s/pdf/eps/ in test for whether we output EPS images (#309379).
+
+2005-07-18  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>
+
+	* m4/as-libtool-tags.m4: Ooh, backported from libtool 1.6. Much
+	better. Thanks, Paolo Bonzini!
+	
+	* m4/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):

+	* m4/gst-error.m4:
+	  add macro to set ERROR_CFLAGS
+
+2005-06-30  Jan Schmidt  <thaytan@mad.scientist.com>
+
+	* gst-autogen.sh:
+	  Remove the old autoregen.sh if it exists before recreating it,
+	  to prevent confusing any shell process that might be reading it
+	  currently.
+
+2005-06-29  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/gtk-doc.m4:
+	  added
+
+2005-06-03  Stefan Kost  <ensonic@users.sf.net>

+	* gst-autogen.sh: create autoregen.sh *before* shifting the options
+
+2005-05-17  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* gst-autogen.sh: only update autoregen.sh on actual runs
+
+2005-03-11  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/check.m4: m4 from the check unit test suite
+
+2004-12-14  David Schleef  <ds@schleef.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-arch.m4: remove MMX stuff, since it doesn't work and
+	isn't needed anywhere
+
+2004-12-08  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

+2004-06-12  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>
+
+	* m4/as-scrub-include.m4:
+	  sync with upstream to 0.1.4.  Fixes #132440
+
+2004-06-07  Benjamin Otte  <otte@gnome.org>
+
+	* m4/gst-feature.m4:
+	  write a big marker into configure output when checking next plugin
+	  to allow easier parsing of why plugins are(n't) built.

+
+# The variables $(pyexecdir) and $(pkgpyexecdir) are provided as

+#
+# SYNOPSIS
+#
+#   AX_CREATE_STDINT_H [( HEADER-TO-GENERATE [, HEDERS-TO-CHECK])]
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   the "ISO C9X: 7.18 Integer types <stdint.h>" section requires the
+#   existence of an include file <stdint.h> that defines a set of
+#   typedefs, especially uint8_t,int32_t,uintptr_t. Many older
+#   installations will not provide this file, but some will have the
+#   very same definitions in <inttypes.h>. In other enviroments we can
+#   use the inet-types in <sys/types.h> which would define the typedefs
+#   int8_t and u_int8_t respectivly.
+#
+#   This macros will create a local "_stdint.h" or the headerfile given
+#   as an argument. In many cases that file will just "#include
+#   <stdint.h>" or "#include <inttypes.h>", while in other environments
+#   it will provide the set of basic 'stdint's definitions/typedefs:
+#
+#     int8_t,uint8_t,int16_t,uint16_t,int32_t,uint32_t,intptr_t,uintptr_t
+#     int_least32_t.. int_fast32_t.. intmax_t
+#
+#   which may or may not rely on the definitions of other files, or
+#   using the AC_CHECK_SIZEOF macro to determine the actual sizeof each
+#   type.
+#
+#   if your header files require the stdint-types you will want to
+#   create an installable file mylib-int.h that all your other
+#   installable header may include. So if you have a library package
+#   named "mylib", just use
+#
+#        AX_CREATE_STDINT_H(mylib-int.h)
+#
+#   in configure.ac and go to install that very header file in
+#   Makefile.am along with the other headers (mylib.h) - and the
+#   mylib-specific headers can simply use "#include <mylib-int.h>" to
+#   obtain the stdint-types.
+#
+#   Remember, if the system already had a valid <stdint.h>, the
+#   generated file will include it directly. No need for fuzzy
+#   HAVE_STDINT_H things... (oops, GCC 4.2.x has deliberatly disabled
+#   its stdint.h for non-c99 compilation and the c99-mode is not the
+#   default. Therefore this macro will not use the compiler's stdint.h
+#   - please complain to the GCC developers).

+dnl
+dnl This macro adds a command line argument to allow the user to enable
+dnl or disable a feature, and if the feature is enabled, performs a supplied
+dnl test to check if the feature is available.
+dnl
+dnl The test should define HAVE_<FEATURE-NAME> to "yes" or "no" depending
+dnl on whether the feature is available.
+dnl
+dnl The macro will set USE_<FEATURE-NAME> to "yes" or "no" depending on
+dnl whether the feature is to be used.
+dnl Thomas changed this, so that when USE_<FEATURE-NAME> was already set
+dnl to no, then it stays that way.
+dnl
+dnl The macro will call AM_CONDITIONAL(USE_<FEATURE-NAME>, ...) to allow
+dnl the feature to control what is built in Makefile.ams.  If you want
+dnl additional actions resulting from the test, you can add them with the
+dnl ACTION-IF-USE and ACTION-IF-NOTUSE parameters.
+dnl
+dnl FEATURE-NAME        is the name of the feature, and should be in

+\`configure' configures GStreamer CE Plugins 0.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
